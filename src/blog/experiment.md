My experiments provided some important results and have established a solid foundation for the rest of my research project. In my first set of graphs, I was able to compare the mortality rates of overdoses in general, overdoses related to opioids, and overdoses related to cocaine. This way, I could measure any significant changes from 2015 - 2022 related to overdoses in the united states. Crucially, I was able to discover that overdoses in every drug category have increased by extraordinary magnitudes following the impact of Covid-19. This speaks volumes about the impact the pandemic had on people suffering from substance abuse disorders and their ability to stay clean.

Additionally, I was able to analyze the overdose rates of heroin compared to that of synthetic opioids. Shockingly, heroin overdoses have been on a steady decline over the past 5 years, with substances like Fentynal accounting for the vast majority of deaths in 2022. Through this data, we can observe that it has never been more important to change society's stance on the war on drugs, and better provide life-saving resources to combat the ever-expanding danger of synthetic opioids. 

Below are the graphs I was able to generate using my data:
