## Introduction

The opioid epidemic is unequivocally the worst it has ever been in the history of the United States, and the death toll continues to grow by astronomical magnitudes. The worst year ever recorded for opioid-related overdoses was 2020. The year 2021 shattered those records. Then 2022 followed suit. Since 2010, deaths resulting from opioids have quadrupled, with the largest increases occurring in only the past few years. With the introduction of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, which can be up to one hundred times more potent than heroin, addiction has never been this challenging nor this lethal. According to a scientific research paper published in May 2019, 

>“Fentanyl is cheaper to produce dose-for-dose than heroin, wholesaling at approximately one-tenth of heroin’s price by weight. Given that fentanyl is approximately 30–40 times stronger than heroin, an equivalent dose would therefore be 1/300 or 1/400 of the wholesale price of heroin.” (Illicit fentanyl in the opioid street market: desired or imposed?) 

With potency at all-time highs, and prices being at all-time lows, the pure convenience of sustaining opioid dependency has become nearly inescapable. Rehab facilities struggle to keep up with the number of people seeking help, with capacities often maxed out and rooms for treatment being extremely coveted. Even those lucky enough to find themselves in treatment struggle immensely to remain clean for a significant period, leading many to relapse which proves to oftentimes be fatal. Half-way homes or sober living solutions are far from perfect systems as it relates to post-rehabilitation care. In several cases, it only takes one former addict to relapse under these conditions to create a domino effect for the rest. This never-ending cycle of rehab, sober living, and relapse is a story all too common for addicts across the nation. It is then unsurprising that 

>“studies show that more than 85% of individuals relapse and return to drug use within 1 year of treatment.” (New Findings on Biological Factors Predicting Addiction Relapse Vulnerability)

For this reason, I plan on using my knowledge of R programming and data analysis to identify trends in the United States’ current response to this public health issue, revealing potential directions for both rehabilitation methods and policy to begin supporting people with substance abuse disorders more effectively, preventing the continued, unnecessary loss of life on a national scale. 
  
The CDC’s WONDER database provides a wealth of public information, specifically on mortality rates and their respective causes, which I will be using in conjunction with R studio to draw models and discover statistics that could be beneficial in terms of limiting the grip of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids have on a national scale. The ultimate goal of this project is to better understand which areas of the country are suffering the most, and what the contributing factors to that suffering may be. Through these discoveries, I will be able to generate statistically significant data that lead to seriously impactful changes in the way we are responding to this national crisis. The hope would be to deliver groundbreaking insight that generates forward momentum to finding long-term solutions. Several scientific papers, research articles, news segments, and journalistic pieces of work are ubiquitous when it comes to the war on drugs, opioid addiction, and modern rehabilitation methods. This has made information about this topic easily accessible, allowing me to begin my research without limitations of any sort. As all of the data I am working with relates to public health, it is available to everyone without paywalls or certain clearance levels, allowing me to gather information uninhibited while using trustworthy government-sponsored sources.
 
## The Prototype

My prototype stands as an example of what I am able to achieve in terms of identifying statistical trends with a few tables of data and R programming, demonstrative of what I will be able to accomplish on a much larger scale with more time and data at my disposal. I was able to use data that had been collected from 2015 to 2022 regarding general drug overdoses categorized by substance, year, and month. From this, I was able to generate several plots that made it easier to visualize the tabled data and draw important conclusions from the trends over the past few years. In Figure 1, I began by separating general overdose mortalities into three distinct sub-section: all drug overdoses, opioid-related overdoses (including synthetics), and cocaine-related overdoses. The rationale for this categorization was to see if there was a discernible difference in the increase of mortalities depending on the substance, and whether or not that would provide important information about which substances are posing the most significant threats. The results aligned with my original hypothesis, as it was clear deaths in each category had skyrocketed percentage-wise, with opioids accounting for the vast majority of total overdoses.

An important discovery to note was the impact that Covid-19 and lockdown procedures had on overdose rates and our ability to respond to them across the nation. In both the years 2018 and 2019, it appeared as though overdose rates had reached a plateau, with no significant increases in any fatal overdoses during that period. However, once May 2020 came and went, the United States saw one of its deadliest months for all drug-related overdoses in history as shown in Figure 2. This can be due to several factors, the most obvious being the lack of in-person resources for people struggling with addiction and financial hardships. Those who found themselves in the throes of opioid dependency could no longer access the practices that helped keep them clean and or safe, and those on the brink of drug dependency found themselves thrown over the edge with the number of challenges the pandemic created globally. Initially, I was surprised by the fact that cocaine overdoses mirrored the increase in opioid overdoses, as both substances are radically different in psychological effects and danger profiles. However, I attributed this to the increase of adulterants in substances in recent years, with the purity of drugs decreasing as drug use increased. Many users of cocaine find themselves now accidentally overdosing due to contaminants such as fentanyl and other synthetics that dramatically increase the risk of lethality in cocaine use that would otherwise be nowhere near as dangerous. The same pattern occurs across virtually all illicit substances, especially in drugs like street-bought benzodiazepines where the expected chemical is substituted with fentanyl due to the incredibly low manufacturing costs. Users may consume the regular dose of their chosen substance, but due to the surreptitious presence of fentanyl, they are unknowingly finding themselves at risk of a potentially lethal overdose. This issue is so widespread that first responders often administer Narcan, a medication that halts opioid overdoses in seconds, as it is assumed that an overdose from any substance is almost always opioid-related.

Additionally, I ran a comparative analysis for overdose rates between non-synthetic opioids, such as heroin, versus synthetic opioids, like fentanyl or oxycodone, to compare the usage rates along with their associated mortalities over the past 7 years. The results were devastating, and, unfortunately, not surprising as shown in Figure 3. Following 2015, heroin-related overdoses have seen a steady decline, with the number of deaths per year being 7% less than just 2019 to 2020 alone. However, while initially disguised as an improvement, this decline is emblematic of a much larger, deadlier issue: fentanyl. From 2015 to 2022, synthetic opioid-related deaths went from claiming 10,000 lives to approximately 80,000 annually. This meteoric rise of fentanyl and prescription pain medication abuse has grown at a pace never witnessed before in the history of mankind. Synthetic opioids, as of 2020, account for over 80% of all opioid-related deaths, and 75% percent of all drug overdose-related deaths across the United States. (CDC) For this reason, there has never been a more important time to use analytical tools as a means to identify where and how this rise is most impactful and the ways in which we can begin to stop it.

R studio makes it effortless to isolate data by indicator name, allowing me to run correlation analysis between certain substances and the years they have been used over. With a few lines of code, I am able to generate subsets of data that prove to be incredibly useful when testing my hypotheses against the provided data. Without this tool, a data set containing hundreds of thousands of individual data points would take days in order to accurately interpret and assess. Using the R programming language, I am able to accomplish high-level statistical analytics despite not having a college-level statistics background. For these reasons, I am not concerned that my lack of advanced mathematical education will prevent me from achieving the overarching objectives of my research project. However, throughout the duration of my project, I plan on using this as an opportunity to educate myself on foundational statistical principles and further my confidence in the R programming language in order to maintain the highest level of professionalism throughout my work. 

## Validity of My Experiment

The validity of my results is reliable, as the data I am using has been collected through trusted government agencies and verified throughout a much lengthier process. The true question lies in why the results are the way they are, and identifying the full breadth of contributing factors. When dealing with such a complex issue as public health crises, especially those that intersect with mental health disorders, it is important to understand the multifaceted nature of these problems and remain cognizant of all relevant information. The opioid epidemic will not have one clear solution, as it does not and will never have one clear cause. For this reason, the main objective of my project is to provide a depth of holistic understanding as it pertains to this issue and a clearer idea of what changes need to be implemented in attempts to halt the exacerbation of national mortality rates.

## Conclusion

Looking forward, this is an important issue that continues to evolve as I study it, with new challenges presenting themselves daily. In recent years the use of xylazine, a horse tranquilizer, as a cutting agent has become popular in fentanyl shipments, predictably making it even more harmful, if one can even imagine. (DEA Reports Widespread Threat of Fentanyl Mixed with Xylazine) Even addicts who have been using large doses of fentanyl as a part of their daily habit struggle to survive with the addition of these new additives. On the other hand, as of March 29, 2023, Naloxone, a life-saving opioid antagonist that immediately reverses the effects of an overdose, was FDA-approved for over-the-counter purchases. Improvements in accessibility to medications like this will create important changes in the data to measure, allowing me to continue to modernize my study and provide current results. In the wake of the pandemic, it will be crucial to measure how drug-related overdoses continue to rise and whether or not this can provide more important information about how social isolation can further the severity of substance abuse disorders. With new data emerging every day and databases like the CDC’s WONDER mapping geographic locations with these associated values, it will be essential for my research to remain connected to modern adjustments and alterations to factors of interest. As this data is gathered from occurrences of extreme tragedy, it is required to remain respectful and aware of the ethical implications of this study. Each data point is representative of death, a death that has impacted families and communities in their own unique, individual ways. The gravitas of the situation cannot afford to be lost in transition, as these lives have not simply been reduced to numbers on a screen. The very foundation of this study is to illuminate that the loss of human life can no longer afford to be treated as a statistic, that the nearly 80,000 people who died last year alone cannot just be attributed to unfortunate circumstances, nor can those suffering from addiction and substance abuse disorders continue to be stigmatized and marginalized by society at large.
