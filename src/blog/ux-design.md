Pivoting away from the subject of AI, I would love to explore the intersection of algorithmically driven marketing and psychological user experience practices. I have always been interested in the ways in which people can more effectively engage with the information they are presented with, and how our attention has evolved to match the digital age we now live in. I want to research the ways in which this information can be incorporated into marketing practices and through the use of data science, we can construct algorithms that best cater to the needs of consumers. 

However, in an article written by the Harvard Business Review, the dangers of pure marketing from an analytical standpoint are made clear. They state that instead of exclusively looking into data to solve their marketing problems, they should...

>“be looking for ways to inject humanity — and, yes, actual humans — into their efforts to reach out to customers.” 

I enjoy the idea that appealing to the public cannot simply be done by looking at the numbers, and that in order to truly engage with an audience of any kind there must be some form of human interaction. For example, while there are general rules that guide human consumer behavior, there are several contextual factors (time of day, level of hunger, impulsive behavior) that continue to be neglected at the cost of better understanding our audiences. I think it is important that we learn to incorporate these inherent human qualities into our analytical data, and perhaps craft better-improved algorithms that can measure and adapt to these less predictable factors.

Furthermore, I believe that after establishing metrics that look for a broader range of human qualities, I would love to invest some serious research into how this intersects with user experience design and the best ways to grasp the attention of site visitors in the digital space. With recent studies suggesting that the human attention span in the past twenty years has dropped from 12 seconds to 8 seconds, the internet has played an incredibly important role in altering the way we look for and retain information.

As an aspiring front-end developer, it is crucial for me to understand what exactly about the sounds, visuals, and overall presentation of digital information are so captivating to modern audiences. What are the deciding factors that keep users interested beyond their obligatory 8 seconds of focus? These are the questions I would like to target in the coming weeks.
