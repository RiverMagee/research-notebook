I have a few areas of interest that I hope to explore in throughout this class. I will go on to describe them below, and list potential research ideas for each that I would find fulfilling.

### Artificial Intelligence
Since playing my first video game, I have been interested in artificial intelligence. It has always astonished me the ways in which AI can mimic human mannerisms, and react to special circumstances in dynamic and organic ways. As of late, Open AI’s Chat GPT project has garnered the vast majority of my attention for many reasons. For starters, we have arrived at a point in history where a machine can accurately understand information previously thought to be specific to exclusively human beings. For example, when presented with images that have deeper emotional significance to them, AI is now able to understand what the people in the photo are feeling, why they might be feeling this way, and how that builds into the greater impact of the image overall. The day is slowly approaching where AI conversation will be indistinguishable from human-to-human interactions. I would love to research how machine learning functions at the most basic level, and perhaps achieve a point of skill where I am able to design a very elementary AI of my own.

### Data Analytics
This is a much newer field of interest that I am equally excited to explore. This semester, I have the wonderful opportunity to take Data Analytics 301, in which we get to study and explore the impact of mass data collection practices and the ways in which that data can be converted into computer algorithms to serve the general public. Thus far, we have engaged in discussion over the ethics of today’s technology, and the various ways we can strategically protect ourselves from having our personal privacy exposed and exploited.
