While there is a lot of data surrounding the increased rates of opioid-related overdoses over the past several years, there is little research about modern rehabilitation methods and their long-term effects on sobriety. Simply put, more information is required concerning the contributing factors to opioid addiction and what resources can make a measurable impact on the number of lives saved. More data needs to be collected about which regions are most heavily affected, and how the legislation and stigmatization surrounding drug addiction and substance abuse disorders impact these areas.

We know a knowledge gap exists within the United States as other countries have implemented significant changes, including decriminalization systems that are already returning incredible results in falling substance abuse rates and drug-related deaths. Specifically, in areas of Europe where safe drug consumption rooms have been implemented, not a single overdose has been recorded during these monitored drug use sessions. Along with this, cases of hepatitis C and HIV, which are known to spread throughout communities that use IV methods of drug intake, have plummeted astronomically. With this type of evidence coming out of less equipped regions of the world relative to the United States, there is no excuse to not use these newfound understandings to combat the ever-expanding opioid epidemic. There is a dire need for research on a national level to best understand how we can alter our current response to this public health crisis.

Throughout my research, I discovered several useful articles, with one referencing the positive effects that good samaritan laws have on lowering overdose rates. This helps identify the gap in my knowledge, as this is one of many factors to consider when measuring the data regarding the efficacy of rehabilitation methods in the United States.

In addition, I encountered research surrounding the effect of opioid treatment programs on long-term sobriety post-treatment. The results seemed to prove that treatment, in general, does have positive long-term effects on sobriety for specific groups of addicts. However, there is still a large percentage of people who are resistant to current rehabilitation methods and continue to use them despite receiving support. Another method of treatment for opioid addiction is through medication, mainly Methadone. A study shows significant improvements in rates of relapse and time until relapse in the groups treated with Methadone than those without.

A few questions I developed to guide my research include: How would the decriminalization of illicit drugs, specifically heroin and fentanyl, impact overdose rates and overdose-related deaths geographically? How has the introduction and availability of medications like Naloxone and other overdose-reversing drugs impacted death rates? Have new synthetic opioids and or combinations of illicit drugs increased overdose rates, and if so, where? How effective are modern rehabilitation practices, medications, and sober-living options, in preventing relapses and promoting long-term sobriety?
