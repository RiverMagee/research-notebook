### How will I accomplish my project?

I am planning to pursue a project that involves analyzing data related to the opioid epidemic and the Fentanyl crisis. To complete this project, I will need a computer that can run R Studio and any required packages and libraries to produce my statistical models. Luckily, my personal computer can run the necessary programs, and with internet access, I can pull from public data sets. I will also be using VS Code and a static site builder to create a digital space to present my informative graphs. The development of the website will involve using software such as Netlify, Figma, and Eleventy to accomplish this.

My project will require a large amount of pre-existing data, and I plan to use the CDC's massive database called WONDER to analyze the mortality rates of opioid overdoses. There is no limit to the data I can pull from this database, as it is public health information already available for free. I will compare tens of thousands of data points to generate the best results from my analysis.

While estimating the length of this process is difficult at this stage, I believe that creating statistical models for pre-existing data will take a few days at most. I may need to consider analyzing the data, creating a research paper, and then truly devoting time to creating a beautiful visual platform for my work. The website will include various types of graphs, statistics, and written sections where I explain my study and the broader implications of what I have learned. I will use T-tests and other measures of correlation to prove my results. It is crucial to remember that correlation does not equal causation, and I will take into account all possible factors that could alter the data I am using. When drawing my conclusions, I will ensure that they have not been adulterated by external factors. For example, if I want to measure the increase in opioid overdoses against the change of certain legislation, several factors need to be considered before attempting to measure correlation.
