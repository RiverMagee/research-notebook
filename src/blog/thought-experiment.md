### What do I need to complete my project?

To successfully complete my project, I will need a machine that can run R studio, along with any required packages and libraries to produce my statistical models. My current personal computer can run the requisite programs well, and with access to the internet, I should be able to pull from public data sets. That encompasses all the hardware I would need to complete my project. In terms of software, I will be using VS Code and a static site builder, as a means to create a digital space to present my informative graphs. I may also end up using Python in tandem with R, as both programming languages are useful for data science and visualization. I imagine I would use whatever libraries are standard for data science and analysis for both languages. In terms of developing the website end of things, I would most likely use software such as Netlify, Figma, and Eleventy, in order to create the space to display my work. T

Thus far, I am feeling confident in my knowledge of R programming as I am currently taking Data Analytics this semester and feel very capable in my abilities. Additionally, I have a lot of experience in Python and feel comfortable using its libraries to aid myself in this project. I also have developed sites using a static site builder before, and I feel comfortable deploying them to the web using deployment applications. Even if this project should force me to learn things about the languages and software I plan on using, I don't feel threatened by the challenge. I have not taken a college-level statistics course, so this will be an area of research where I foresee a substantial amount of learning.

### What data will I be using to conduct my study?

My project will require a ton of pre-existing data. The CDC has a massive database called WONDER, which has been used by countless researchers who are studying the same types of statistics that I plan on analyzing. It contains a wealth of information regarding the mortality rates of opioid overdoses and includes geographical information for this data as well. To my current knowledge, there is no limit to the data that I can pull from this database, as it is public health information that is already available to the public. I plan on comparing tens of thousands of data points to truly generate the best results from my analysis.

### How long will this project take?

Estimating the length of this process is difficult at this stage, as I am not 100% certain about the specifics of what I plan on measuring. I believe, if anything, I may be at risk of not having enough to work on as creating the statistical models for preexisting data will take a few days at most. I may need to consider analyzing the data, creating a research paper for this analysis, and then truly devoting time to creating a beautiful visual platform for my work.

### What will the end result be?

The deliverable of my project will be a website that displays an assortment of graphical information regarding the effects of different rehabilitation methods in response to the opioid epidemic and the Fentynal crisis. This will include various types of graphs, statistics, and written sections where I explain my study and the broader implications of what I have learned. I will be using T-tests and other measures of correlation to prove my results.

### What to do should I fail?

Should the original project fail and the data is not usable, I will still be able to pivot and continue my analytical studies perhaps with a different data set. If anything, I would love some guidance should I find myself lost and or intellectually ill-equipped for certain statistical analyses. This could simply be in the form of using suggested resources from faculty or having my study reviewed by department members.

### How can I prove the validity of my study?

The data I plan to use should certainly be large enough to conduct my study, however, it is crucial to remember that correlation does not equal causation. I need to take in all the possible factors that could alter the data I am using, and when I draw my conclusion I need to be sure that they haven't been altered by external factors. For example, if I want to measure the increase in opioid overdoses against the change of certain legislation, several factors need to be considered before attempting to measure a correlation.
